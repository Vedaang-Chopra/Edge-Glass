00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:05.858
Day 2: Proving myself.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.320
Although it seems that the stegosaurs trust me,

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.090
for some unknown reason I feel a certain 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.074
unease.

00:00:14.195 --> 00:00:16.195
I have no clue what could be causing this.

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:19.177
So I must prove myself.

00:00:22.776 --> 00:00:24.776
These beasts are capable of caving

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:26.376
my skull in if they so choose, so

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.676
I must act with the utmost caution.

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:31.781
Every little decision I make

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:33.181
could mean life or death.

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:42.131
The only way to do this is to act as a...

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:43.259
sort of...

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:44.268
pest control.

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.516
The #1 enemy of the Stegosaurus

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:51.304
is the car-- 

00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:52.392
hmm &gt;:/

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:53.450
well...

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:55.647
its other stegosaurs.

00:00:56.717 --> 00:00:57.217
But!

00:00:57.376 --> 00:00:58.785
The carnotaurus can be considered 

00:00:58.785 --> 00:00:59.584
#2.

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:03.974
If there's anything a carno fears,

00:01:04.907 --> 00:01:06.176
it's a stego.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.966
But I'm a close second!

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.472
With my ever-increasing tenacity,

00:01:10.472 --> 00:01:11.750
sheer will,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.232
and clinical insanity

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.880
I drove off the pest!
