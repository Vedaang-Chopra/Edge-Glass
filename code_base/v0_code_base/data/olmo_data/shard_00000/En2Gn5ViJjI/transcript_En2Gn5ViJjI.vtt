This capsule is presented by Canadian Heritage

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.780
Many consider Terry Fox the greatest Canadian
of all time. After losing a leg to cancer,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.910
Fox set out in 1980 to run across the country
to raise money for cancer research. His quest,

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.090
known as the Marathon of Hope, attracted the
attention of more and more Canadians as he

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.970
made his way east from Newfoundland. Thousands
lined the streets and ran alongside him when

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.410
he passed through Ottawa on Canada Day.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.370
A few months later, after running an incredible
5,300 kilometres—about a marathon every

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.390
day for more than four months—he was forced
to abandon the quest when the cancer spread

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.390
to his lungs. Terry Fox died in 1981, but
the courage and determination he showed continues

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.970
to inspire people around the world and has
helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.400
for cancer research.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.640
John Hooper, one of this country’s best-loved
sculptors, saw Terry Fox run when the Marathon

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.500
of Hope passed through New Brunswick. The
regional municipality of Ottawa Carleton commissioned

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.450
Hooper to create this bronze piece in 1983,
one of many erected across the country to

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.450
honour this hero. The sculpture captures Fox
mid-stride, his face a mixture of determination

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.590
and pride, his eyes focused intently on a
distant finish line.
